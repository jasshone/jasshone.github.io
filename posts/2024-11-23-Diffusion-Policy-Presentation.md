### Diffusion Policy Presentation
I gave a presentation on diffusion policy a while back for an AI reading group -- it goes over the main intuitions behind diffusion in RL/imitation learning, as well as some brief information on my summer project.

Here are the link to the slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gfUBlBwK9GP410Q7lKt7KFp9dFQ3SIdWHOUHvaOTGCQ/edit?usp=sharing

Hope it is useful in some way!
